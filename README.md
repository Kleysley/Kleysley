- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kleysley
- 👀 I’m interested in: programming Android apps, AI, Python, Cyber security and ethical hacking (challenges)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: WHAT I WANT. I teach myself all the coding. If I have a new idea, i will start coding it and that's how I learn. I have never had any kind of tutor.
  right now I just finished a TicTacToe game with a perfect AI "WITHOUT COPYING A SINGLE LINE" (, he says proudly.) 
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to: collaborate on nothing as I want to code my own projects and I'm also busy answering questions on stackoverflow.
- 📫 How to reach me: IDK leave a comment on my Main Repository?
- My stackoverflow name is ctrl_See.
